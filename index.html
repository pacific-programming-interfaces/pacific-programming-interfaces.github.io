<h1>Pacific Programming Interfaces Confab (PPIC)</h1>

<p>PPIC is an informal meetup to muse on programming interfaces and on, roughly, how to fill the gap between spreadsheets and general-purpose textual programming.
The format varies week to week: one week we might discuss a paper or talk, the next someone might present work in progress for feedback, and the next we might argue about some spicy question like, "Do end-users even want to automate their tasks?".
Visitors welcome, even if you're not in the Pacific time zone!</p>
